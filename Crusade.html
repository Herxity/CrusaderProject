&quot;CLAY NO!&quot;
#l003#

The young man grabbed the boy and hoisted him over his shoulder, running as fast as he could.

&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot;

&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO, CLAY!&quot;

The young girl&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, the boy only could watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and as she got further with every step.

#l003#
The young man was too strong for the boy to wrench himself from his grip, but even then...the boy&#39;s fear would have kept himself chained down... 

#f003#

[Play Track &quot;Love Dream&quot;]
This is the story of a young boy who never wanted to be a hero, never desired to answer the call to action, never sought to save lives. 
This is the story of a yong boy who, just as clay, is molded into a hero: one who answers the world&#39;s call to action.
He once wished to live a normal life...
But normalcy is a luxury only a god could afford...

Indeed, there are many actors in this story, and many play multiple parts.
Royals, who sit on thrones of trust.
Fools, who were called to serve in their court.
Lovers, who love a catastrophic love.
Lovers, whose tragic separation may someday lead to an even more tragic disaster.
A Court Mage, who must train the Hero.
Victims, who had their trust betrayed.
A Rebel, who seeks to overthrow the kingdom for the sake of the victims.
A Dreamer, one who dreamt of freedom since her childhood.
A Victim, from one whose faith was betrayed.
And finally, our Hero, molded from what was once a simple child.

At the steps of a rustic-looking abandoned home, in the outskirts of a small village, the excited voices of children could be heard amidst the sounds of crickets during sunset...

&quot;Neo! Neo! Tell us the story again!&quot;, a young boy with brown hair says to an older boy sitting in front of him.

&quot;Haven&#39;t you had enough already, Clay? It&#39;s the 3rd time I&#39;ll be telling you now, seriously?&quot;, the older boy responds exasperated.

&quot;No fair, Neo! You promised you&#39;d tell us since we explored the forests together with you to find birds yesterday with Louis!&quot; a young girl sitting next to Clay says, &quot;After all, you didn&#39;t want to go rabbit-hunting with us today.&quot;

&quot;You too, Thia? What&#39;s gotten into you too? It&#39;s the same story your parents tell you!&quot;, Neo says, &quot;Also, we don&#39;t want to get in the way of the hunters, Thia you have to understand!&quot;

&quot;Neo! You promised me and Thia! A promise is a promise&quot;, Clay crosses his arms, sitting down in front of Neo.

&quot;Yeah!&quot;, Thia follows.

&quot;Okay okay...you two are too easily entertained...&quot;

#t0#
#p3#
&quot;Wow, that War God seems so cool!&quot;, the young girl says, swinging around a stick as if it were a sword, &quot;but my mom says &#39;warrior&#39; instead of &#39;war&#39;. Hiyah-!&quot;

&quot;Hey- Quit it- Ow! Neo help!&quot;, the young boy responds, being her training dummy.

&quot;Okay okay, you two, enough playing around. It&#39;s dark, we need to get you home.&quot;

&quot;Neo!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Clay?&quot;, Neo pauses as he was about to get up.

&quot;Will Seraphus really return someday?&quot;

Neo pauses and thinks, then smirks.

&quot;If she does, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll protect you&quot;, he says, puffing out his chest proudly.

&quot;Whoaaahhh!&quot;, the two kids&#39; faces were absolutely beaming at his reaction.

&quot;Okay okay, it&#39;s time to go, for real now.&quot;

&quot;Fiiiiiiiinnnnnneeeee&quot;, Thia tosses away the stick in her hand, Clay flinches thinking it was at him.
#p7#
Neo picks up his bow, gets up, and starts walking down the steps of his house when he notices something off in the distance, &quot;That smell...is it blood?&quot;

&quot;Neo? You look worried.&quot;

&quot;Neoooooooooooooo, c&#39;mon I want to practice the sword more, are you sure we have to have to HAVE TO leave?&quot;

&quot;Hold on, stay here, and behind me&quot;, Neo draws an arrow.

&lt;i&gt;*We&#39;re downwind...so that must mean it&#39;s coming from the forest. I know the hunting party went that way, but certainly there wouldn&#39;t be that big of a catch this time of year.&lt;/i&gt;,* he thinks, before noticing someone running from the forestline, south of where they were at the abandoned home, &quot;Is that, Louis...?&quot; Neo mutters to himself, lowering his bow.

&quot;HEY! LOUIIIIS!&quot;, Clay says, jumping out from behind Neo.

Neo&#39;s sense&#39;s suddenly screamed &quot;RUN!&quot;

Neo slung his bow over his back,  picked up Clay and Alethia, and ran back to the village as fast as he could.

&quot;HELP! SOMEBODY! THEY&#39;RE HERE! THE FURIE-*URGH*&quot;

Neo glanced back and saw the child erupt into a spray of crimson, after a dark shadow flew across his body faster than he could see.

&quot;NEO WHAT&#39;S GOING ON? DID HE SAY FURIES?&quot;

&quot;NEO IS IT TRUE? WHAT ABOUT OUR MOMS AND DADS?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;M RUNNING INTO THE VILLAGE NOW.&quot;

The sound of his heavy breathing as he ran faster than he ever thought possible was all the two kids he held could hear. Eventually, the village returned to view, with one end of it bathed in a frightening orange and red shade...the sounds of battle and crying permeating the land.

&quot;Someone....anyone.... has to be here that can help us?&quot;

Neo recognized a neighbor in the distance trying to flee with his family, he was about to turn to sprint towards them. Then suddenly, a dark humanoid form pounced on them...tearing the family apart in a horrific display of crimson. Neo had no choice but to sprint the other way, trying to keep himself from retching at the sight of another murder. 

&quot;Neo, where are our parents!? It&#39;s dark!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking I&#39;m looking, just don&#39;t let go, okay?!&quot;

Neo felt  them nod while he carried them.

Eventually, he reached the town. He ran through what should have been familiar city streets....but the darkness and chaos made it feel like a foreign land.

He ran around, every second feeling like an eternity, his arms fatigued from carrying the kids. 

&quot;Neo! Stop! Turn around!&quot;

A voice that had been calm all his life had cried out at Neo in worry and fear: his mother&#39;s.

&quot;Mom! Thank the Gods! You&#39;re safe!&quot;

Neo ran to his mother, set down Thia and Clay, and embraced her.

&quot;Yes Neo, but now&#39;s not the time. Look around you.&quot;

His mother stepped out of his embrace and reminded him once more of the dire situation, &quot;Your father is out fighting-&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;, without hesitation, Neo slung his bow off his shoulder, reached for an arrow, and began to turn to the flames.

&quot;Neo! Wait! He gave you a task!&quot;, Neo&#39;s mother said, grabbing the hood of Neo&#39;s cloak.

&quot;What? A task? In the middle of all this? What could he possibly-&quot;, Neo&#39;s mother yanked him close, and whispered to him.

&quot;*Clay and Alethia&#39;s parents are out fighting as well. He&#39;s trusting you to take them out of the town and to safety in a city.&quot;*

&quot;But...it&#39;s father!&quot;

&quot;NEO!&quot;, his mother yelled, amidst the screaming and chaos around them, &quot;Please...listen to us and go to safety.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;, Neo could only nod. His mother embraced him once more, and she said, &quot;I&#39;ll have to go tend to the wounded, here-&quot;, she pulled out a small bag, &quot;Hold onto this, it&#39;s filled with things you may need, and these are for Thia and Clay&quot;, she handed two more bags to them. &quot;Take Alpheus with you too&quot;, she motioned towards the Greater Wolf pup at her side.

Neo nodded, trying to hold back tears.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon, my son&quot;, she turned him around and sent him off. 

Bags in hand, they set out, away from the fighting.

&quot;There&#39;s a carriage that my dad kept for emergencies, we can use it-&quot;

Neo nearly ran to fetch it, but realized it was likely taken for the fighting.

&quot;Nevermind, we&#39;ll have to go on foot.&quot;

They all ran through the streets, sticking to seemingly familiar paths.

&quot;Neoo! When can we see our parents?&quot;, Thia groaned.

&quot;They said they&#39;ll be with us soon, they&#39;re just getting ready&quot;, Neo told a lie he knew he&#39;d regret.

The two kids silently followed. 

Eventually, they reached the western edge of the village. All the fighting was taking place on the eastern side. There were a few houses still here.

*Crunch*

Neo&#39;s instincts kicked in, and he pulled the kids to the edge of one of the houses, backs against the wall, and he covered their mouths. They already knew to just follow Neo.

Neo looked around the corner of the building, watching as he saw a humanoid figure in a red-eyed mask walk in front of the house. It had the same scent a Fury had, but far too human, and lacked the same dark aura hovering around it.  

&lt;i&gt;*What the hell? Now? Gah, I can&#39;t make heads or tails of who or what that is&lt;/i&gt;,* He thought, looking at it.

&lt;i&gt;*If it&#39;s a person... certainly it&#39;s not a Fury. Maybe someone&#39;s trying to confuse the Furies by dressing as them. I can probably ask for help.*&lt;/i&gt;

Hey poked his head out and said, &quot;Hey, uh, are you trying to escape to-&quot;

The figure reached out its hand, and suddenly the monsters Neo feared the most began to materialize behind it.

Neo grabbed the two kids and ran around the other side of the house, in pure panic.

&lt;i&gt;*ESCAPE, I HAVE TO GET OUT, I CAN&#39;T FIGHT THOSE, WHY DID I DO THAT, I CAN&#39;T DIE TODAY*&lt;/i&gt;

Neo&#39;s mind was a assaulted by a whirlwind of fear as he hoisted the two kids over his shoulders and ran. He heard the demonic cooing of rhe Furies begin, as they started chasing after them...he was their target.

He began weaving through houses left and right, the kids having not fully caught up to the situation at hand. All they know is they were supposed to be quiet.

He found a house with a half-opened door...thinking he maybe ran far enough, he ran into it to try hiding.

He barricaded the doors with furniture, and shut all the windows.

He knew one thing about Furies, which was that they had horrible senses. A Fury typically has poor smell, subpar eyesight, mediocre hearing, and poor reasoning. However, they have two skills that make them even more frightening: endless persistence and high strength and agility. To add to this, they have an unpredictable and maniacal way of acting. They may completely ignore you while watching you, then kill you in the seconds following. They may bang endlessly on a door, clawing away at the walls of a home, rattle the windows, despite nobody being inside.

All Neo needs to do is ensure he&#39;s covered all entrances, and the Furies might just pass by or simply make noise and leave. They may be insane, but they&#39;ll leave once they&#39;re convinced there&#39;s nothing to kill.

Neo had his back against the wall furthest from the entrance inside the house, the two children beside him. He had his bow aimed at the door. Alpheus rested in Thia&#39;s lap.

&quot;You two are doing great...just stay like this and everything will be okay...okay?&quot;

They nodded.

Minutes passed, he heard the furies roaming around, a few rattles at other houses. Thankfully, their own house was untouched.

Having felt the danger subsided, Neo got up.

In that instant, his field of view was obscured by brick and stone dust, and Neo was sent flying back. He heard Clay and Thia scream, Alpheus howl, and demonic screeching.

In a daze, he laid slumped against the other wall for a moment, before looking up. He watched as that disguised figure stood in the place of the wall where they were just sitting at. It grabbed Thia by the arm, she tried to free herself, kicking and screaming, but it merely tossed her behind it, into the street that was now exposed, he heard her yelp as she hit the wall of the house across the street. Alpheus ran to her side, albeit having been seemingly injured too.

Neo raised an arm over himself, and started muttering.

&quot;...*I bear all things, as does a mighty beast of the woods. My strength is unfaltering, my endurance is unending...I am-&quot;*

Neo&#39;s healing incantation was cut short, as he coughed from the dust. He felt the effects, but it wasn&#39;t enough to be able to fight any of these monsters before him.

Clay laid beside him, terrified, &quot;T-Thia?&quot;

Neo watched as Clay was trying to get up. But he knew neither of them had a chance against either of these things. 

He did the only thing he could do. He picked up Clay, and got up. 

The figure didn&#39;t seem to do anything...its eyes however were a much brighter red than before...nearly glowing.

Clay weakly was trying to move to Thia.

Neo clenched his teeth. He sensed the house&#39;s structure had weakened dramatically. He could tell it was old. The wall to his left was starting to buckle. He felt behind him, a major crack was forming.

The houses in this village were supported partially by their construction, but also by runes etched into the walls. The blown-out wall in front of him meant maybe hundreds of runes were decimated. The slowly buckling wall to his left meant more were being destroyed. The crack behind him meant this wall was on it&#39;s way out too.

*This house has no hope anyways,* he thought.

&quot;&lt;*SHOCKWAVE&gt;&quot;*

He forced as much mana out of him as he could in the duration of the one-word incantation, and concentrated the effects on the wall behind him. A hole, big enough for him to tumble out of, was formed instantly. The house began to cave in much faster. If he could just circle back around fast enough, maybe he could save Thia. 

Watching the house collapse, he knew the figure was trapped within. Once he reached the left side of the almost completely collapsed house, he set Clay down and reached for his bow. The bow had been scratched and bent a bit, but thankfully it was useable. He casted a spell over the arrow he held, and it began to glow a bright white. This was the one spell handed down in Neo&#39;s family. He drew back the arrow, stepped out of the corner of the rubble, and prepared to fire at the Furies that crept closer to Alethia. They seemed to be wary of Alpheus, strangely enough, who was barking and howling at the two of them. He knew this shot could pierce the heads of both Furies at once. 
&quot;&lt;LUMINOUS BO-&gt;&quot;, Just as he was about to fire, he saw movement in the rubble. Terror returned to him in that instant, and he fired at the dark form that emerged instead. The arrow met its target and the figure reeled back in pain. 

Neo, somehow, knew that wouldn&#39;t have killed it. He was too afraid to land a killing blow on something so human. He only shot its shoulder. He trembled. He dropped his bow. The furies were still focused on Thia. They began to crawl closer.

&quot;Thia!&quot;, Clay seemed to think that there was an opportunity. 

&quot;CLAY NO!&quot;

Neo grabbed Clay and hoisted him over his shoulder, turning to the forest.

&quot;NEO WE NEED TO SAVE HER!&quot;

&quot;STOP PLAYING HERO! YOU&#39;LL DIE TOO!&quot;

Thia&#39;s injured form was laying on the ground behind them, Clay only could watch as the shadowy humanoid creatures crept closer to her, and as she got further with every step.

Neo was too strong for Clay to wrench himself from Neo&#39;s grip, but even then...Clay&#39;s fear would have kept him chained down.

Neo was running and kept running. He was running as fast as he could. All he really could do was run. He was no hero himself. All he knew was running. When he yelled at Clay for playing a hero, he was also yelling at himself.

Neo ran into the forest. He knew these grounds. A few hours north was a vassal city to the War God. Certainly someone there would help.

However, he felt a sharp pain in his leg, and fell. Clay tumbled a few feet ahead of him. Neo looked at his leg and saw a purplish chain around his leg, which was covered in spikes. They dug into his ankle as if they were teeth. In an instant, his body flew back in the direction he ran from, leaving Clay alone. 

Clay had hit his head against a tree when he fell. The last thing he saw was Neo suddenly vanishing into the forest, and eventually, he passed out. 

## Chapter 0 - Memories of that unfamiliar face

&quot;Wake up!... -alive still.... Don&#39;t.... it end ..., boy!&quot;, a stranger says.

I&#39;m waking up. I remember my mouth was dry. My neck also was stiff from resting at the roots of that tree I hit my head on. I saw an old man wearing a grey tunic stand above me. He wore a blindfold.

&quot;Neo...Thia...where-&quot;, were the words I first spoke when I finally regained my senses.

&quot;Shhh...&quot;, the old man picked me up and sat him properly against the tree, the tree was rough.
&quot;You were badly hurt when I found you. Luckily, you made it. Here, have some soup&quot;, he said to me in that comforting voice of his.

The old man handed me a wooden bowl. It smelled good. The smell of freshly cooked food had distracted me from my worries, and I realized I was much hungrier than I expected .  The food nearly scalded my tongue as I wolfed it down.

&quot;Whoa whoa! Easy! Nobody is taking it from you,&quot; the kind man had assured me.

When I had finally finished eating, the man asked, &quot;So, do you happen to have a name?&quot;
&quot;Clay!&quot;, I remember responding, the food seemed to have lightened my spirits.

&quot;Clay? My, what a fitting name, your personality matches clay.&quot;, he said, making one of his usual jokes about my name that he still makes to this day.

&quot;Person....Alley?&quot;, I responded(to be fair, I had no proper training in language or writing).

The old man chuckled, &quot;You seem like you could be anything, the world is your oyster, Clay.&quot;

&quot;Oyster?&quot;, I again responded; I&#39;m still not sure what these are.

The man shook his head, smirking and replied, &quot;Ah forget it...wait, I forgot to introduce myself. You may call me Grimstone.&quot;

And so the story unfolds between the Court Mage and the Hero. Or rather, Grimstone and Clay. Unfortunately, Neo isn&#39;t the Hero of this story. Clay is.

I am Clay.



## Chapter 1 - Beginnings of Heroism

Sunlight pierces through my dream, the first thing I hear is the sound of shoveling. Yesterday evening it was snowing outside our cabin, I bet the Old Man is trying to clear the snow from our vegetable garden. 

I  get up and yell through the window, &quot;Oi! Grimstone! Must be cold out there!&quot;

My master seemed startled. He takes a defensive stance as he attempts to figure out the source of the voice, before aiming his shovel at me.
&quot;Oh! Look who finally woke up,&quot; he says chuckling.
&quot;You&#39;re crazy&quot;, I respond,&quot; getting up this early and going out in the cold.&quot;
 He scoops up a shovelful of snow and raises it towards the window, &quot;Well you&#39;re coming out to help me dig out the snow unless you&#39;d like me to toss it into your room.&quot;
At his cold-hearted threat, I grab my cloak and head outside. The sunlight reflects off the snow strongly, my eyes take a minute to adjust. I veil my eyes with one hand, and with the other, I reach around the porch till I find the shovel. The old wood creaks as I make my way down to the garden.
[[I should ask about the Gods]]
[[I&#39;ll keep it to myself]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="I should ask about the Gods" tags="" position="3465,223" size="100,100"># Ask about that old story about the Gods

After a few minutes of shoveling, my dream comes to mind, &quot;Hey Grim, you remember the old story about the 6 Gods and Seraphus? The one we heard in the Wisdom Goddess Kingdom when we were tryna to sell at a carnival there?&quot;

&quot;That old tale? That&#39;s just what the Bards say&quot;, says Grimstone.

&quot;Whaddya mean? Ya don&#39;t believe it?&quot;, I replied, confused at his doubtful tone towards the legend.

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe, but I don&#39;t necessarily see it as something to be believed either.&quot;

&quot;So you do or don&#39;t believe? Why are you being so wishy-washy about it, Old Man?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll understand when you gaze upon this world with the same eyes as I do one day, Clay.&quot;

&quot;Old Man....you sayin’ I&#39;m gonna be blind someday too?&quot;

&quot;How many times must I tell you, child, I am not blind. I merely choose to not see.&quot;

&quot;Right, just like yesterday when you chose to let that scummy merchant swindle us out of a gold coin? You know how long we need to work to earn that back?!&quot; 

I clutch my forehead trying to calm my nerves. Thinking too much about money troubles makes my head hurt.

&quot;Clay, I tell you time and time again, money comes and goes-&quot;

&quot;Yes well, when it goes entirely, then the food goes as well.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear the part where I said we earn the money too? My alchemy has been quite profitable as of late.... let&#39;s see that is....&quot;, he reaches into his satchel and pulls out a small coin pouch, shaking it in his hand.

&quot;Twenty gold coins!&quot;, he exclaims with a smile.

&quot;And we&#39;re how much in debt again?&quot;

&quot;Two thousand.&quot;, the old man replies plainly, the smile fading.

&quot;So basically, we got less than negative nineteen hundred coins to our name. This really isn&#39;t our money to be losing, Old Man.&quot;

&quot;You worry too much. Anyways, keep shoveling, this snow won&#39;t clear from our walkway itself.&quot;

I look sideways at him, squinting, &quot;Wait. Do you not have fire magic?&quot;

&quot;Yes? What of it?&quot;

I rest my head against the shovel, trying to maintain my composure, &quot;Well, why not....I dunno, crazy idea....but maybe, just maybe.....USE IT?!&quot;

I may or may not have lost my composure.

&quot;Ah, but that takes the merit and joy out of the process.&quot;

I roll my eyes and continue plowing through the snow.

[[We finish shoveling...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="I&#39;ll keep it to myself" tags="" position="4266,221" size="100,100">Some time passes, and we&#39;ve been shoveling in relative silence.
Eventually Grimstone speaks up, &quot;Well Clay, I must say, lately you&#39;ve started become very capable.&quot;
&quot;What does that mean...?&quot;
&quot;It means, I think you&#39;ve reached the age where you can finally care for yourself: in terms of magical education.&quot;
Oh good. I thought he was going to kick me out, I&#39;ve broken his windows more times than I can count lately.
&quot;Really? Does this mean you won&#39;t be teaching me anymore?&quot;
&quot;That is correct. I took you in and promised I&#39;d teach you the fundamentals of magic, but now that you&#39;ve come this far, I think you can start conducting your own research.&quot;
Research!?
&quot;Research?!&quot;
&quot;Yes, research. Of course, you don&#39;t need to start off creating your own spells or schools of magic, you could start off with something as simple as reading on a class of spells you&#39;re unfamiliar with. Either way, you&#39;re now primed to teach yourself from now on.&quot;
&quot;Teach myself? What? C&#39;mon Grim, you&#39;re not that old, surely you can keep going.&quot;
&quot;No no Clay, that is definitely not the issue&quot;, Grim responds shaking his head,&quot;This is all a part of you maturing. You need to learn to survive on your own. You have all the skills now, but now you need to practice doing it.&quot;
&quot;I guess&quot;, Grim&#39;s reasoning seems untouchable
&#39;&#39;Grim and Clay keep discussing research here&#39;&#39;

I reach for my sword. Even disoriented, I&#39;d know where it is. I swing it out in an arc in front of me, but it bounces off with a *CLANG.* I lost my grip on the blade and it flew somewhere.

 I channel energy to my hands. 

It doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s in front of me. I&#39;ll kill it. I&#39;ll kill it before it kills me.

&quot;Lay waste to my enemies, *&lt;**FLAMING WIND*-&quot;**
&quot;CLAY GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, CHILD!&quot;
I cut the activation short. The Old Man&#39;s voice echos through the cave. My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 
&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.
He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?
&quot;Y-yes?&quot;
&quot;No more using the &lt;Blind Leap&gt;, got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;
&quot;B-...fine.&quot;
I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. Blind Leap enables him to move at insane speeds at the cost of both mana, and sight(only as you move, of course). The trick for him, of course, is that he is already blind. It amounts to being the perfect skill for him. He told me about the times he&#39;d use it to get through some labyrinths without even needing to fight. He&#39;d go in, take what he needs, and leave. It was like picking fruit. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;

&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;
Grimstone&#39;s experience from his past gives him enough intuition to say how a cave is structured from how the echo sounds. Granted he can&#39;t give you a detailed map. He picks up on certain *qualities* that are present in the echoes throughout the cave. I think the part about the mine is at the bottom though was simply a good guess from not having seen it thus far.

&quot;Well, I believe the mine should be right here-&quot;
He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside nearly effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;
&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*
The breathing incantation is an extremely long and intricate chant, something resembling a prayer to the wind. What it actually is, is a high-level spell that has been fine-tuned down to the syllable. There are many drawbacks to spells. Powerful spells with short incantations have extraordinarily high mana costs. Spells with short incantations and low mana cost have low power output. This spell has no need for power output, but rather consistency. In fact, the entire incantation spans the length of a small spellbook. Nobody knows the entire incantation, but that&#39;s not important to know, as the power output is so low that the recoil is nonexistent. The spell creates pure air in a thin film around the user and does so during the incantation, and usually lasts for a few seconds after pausing or stopping the incantation (enough to briefly say something). Unfortunately, there is no way to have this spell run indefinitely with a short incantation without a much higher drain to your mana supply (Unless you&#39;re Grimstone, he&#39;s gone so far as to make this spell a passive ability of his, from inhuman amounts of training).

Of course, this becomes problematic once we have to cast other spells, as we can&#39;t chant two spells simultaneously. This is where spells begin to fail as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; to life&#39;s problems. If we **really** needed to cast other spells, however, we have charms attached to our belts that fill our lungs with air, at a very high mana cost. Charms only are useful for emergencies, when getting out alive in the present moment is more important than keeping your mana available for miscellaneous tasks.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he doesn&#39;t seem to want to let the joke go,&quot;as far as we need to. More likely about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something. I can&#39;t tell what it is within the darkness of the cave.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

&quot;*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.&quot;*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

We should...

[[Risk It]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Risk It" tags="" position="3897.666666666667,599" size="100,100"># Risk it.

Risk? Pfft. I&#39;ve fought tougher opponents.

Namely, Grimstone.

I tug on Grimstone&#39;s sleeve, he knows I want to fight it.

The Dragon is settling into it&#39;s form, we have a few more seconds before it starts charging at us.

&quot;...don&#39;t do anything foolish, understood?&quot;

I nod.

We split up, I begin running from the right down a sloped section of the cave room alongside the wall, and hide behind a Stalagmite of red Crystal. I have to make sure I don&#39;t touch the crystal, they cause serious burns. The Dragon seems to be facing Grimstone. I&#39;m on its right side now.

The plan is to get to flank it, and hit the weak points in it&#39;s armor. Easier said than done.

&quot;*&lt;Earth Spire&gt;*!&quot;

A spike of rock slams diagonally up and into the side of the Crystal Dragon, but the rock crumbles on impact. 

&quot;***GRAWWWWWHHH**!!!&quot;*

We may have angered it. 

It begins charging in the direction of Grimstone, who begins to charge at it also.

That fool has no idea how dangerous that is. Charging straight at Grimstone? Worst decision you could make.

Right as they are about to collide, the Dragon swings its head up to attempt to screwer Grimstone, but he seemingly vanishes. 

Grimstone&#39;s not on the ground.

I look up, he wasn&#39;t tossed into the cave ceiling either.

&quot;AHAAHA, YOU HAVE SOME FIGHT IN YA, OLD SPORT?&quot;

Grimstone says, clinging to the Dragon&#39;s horn.

The Dragon seems to be enraged at this development, and begins flailing it&#39;s face around.

That&#39;s my queue, I grab the charm attached to my necklace, and pour mana into it. My lungs suddenly expand, and I start chanting.

&quot;*Oh unceasing tide that flows through the world, open your floodgates upon my enemies, and let the ocean&#39;s majesty be made manifest, &lt;Water Surge&gt;!&quot;*

As I conclude the chant, I leap out from behind the stalagmite, and aim my hand at the Crystal Dragon.

*3....2....1....Release!*

A massive torrent of water shoots from my hand, the Crystal Dragon is engulfed in it, and Grimstone casts his spell in response,&quot;&lt;Thousand Tundra&gt;!&quot;

A chill ran through my body as I watched icy frost envelop the Crystal Dragon. Its body began to slowly crack and split, the light in its eyes faded. I took a look at myself: I was shivering, and the hairs on my arms were covered in frost as well. Grimstone lept to me and created a flame in his hands and handed me the flame. 

Some spells can be handed to others to maintain, this fire spell is one of them. The small flame is  slowly helping, I feel my hands growing warmer. I turn to Grimstone and say, &quot;I-Is it dead?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, he replies, &quot;the core is intact.&quot;

He walks over to the froze Crystal Dragon body, and reaches to the horn, it&#39;s mostly covered in ice. It seems like you could take it off if you saw it or wit-

*CRACK*

&quot;Item Retrieved, shall we go, Clay?&quot; Grimstone pockets the newly acquired Serpent Diamond shaped as a Crystal Dragon horn.

How much strength does it even require to remove it is beyond me.

But reta

&quot;Yeah, time to head back to Lord Whatshisface.&quot;

### On the Way Back...

Me and Grimstone finally reached Tomb again. The cool night air makes the city street feel even more silent. Crowgarden’s streets are really is dead(at night, that is).

I sense something.

&quot;Clay, stop&quot;, Grimstone puts a hand out in front of me, &quot;We are being followed.&quot;

Grimstone seems to agree, the air feels stale...dry...dead.

&quot;My my, if it isn&#39;t Grimmy~.&quot;

Who in the world is this? Only I get to give my master stupid names, and even *I* don&#39;t give names this bad.

&quot;... CLAY RUN!&quot;

Grimstone is likely trying to deceive the enemy, I&#39;ll circle back around and flank them.

I break out into a sprint, and hear the two combatants’ voices being lost in the wind rushing past my face. I run through an alleyway, but it leads nowhere. 

However, the walls don&#39;t.

&quot;Spirits of those that crawl upon the ground when the sun goes out, the spiders, the roaches, the flies, the ants...I call on your strength, &lt;Night Crawler&gt;!&quot;

I start climbing up the wall, Night Crawler only works when the sun is out, thankfully it seems like midnight. 

I make it up to the building, and start running back. I&#39;m already exhausted, but I have to aid Grimstone. My legs feel heavier with every jump. I can see them down on the street ahead.

The woman seems to be walking to Grimstone, but he stands still. He seems to be trying to stall for time.
I brace myself. I’ve never turned a spell against a person before. Realistically, my attack couldn’t kill something that could make Grimstone tell me to run, but it can certainly create an opening. 
About 5 seconds before she reaches Grimstone, there is only one incantation I have that works in this situation, at least against enemies with sight. This spell always causes me to pass out. But I only have one chance.

“*Raging Storms...
...Billowing Clouds...”*
It almost feels like the blood in my body is being drawn out of me as I chant.

“...*&lt;Tempest Strike&gt;*.”

My vision goes white.

### Recovery

Well. How should I put this?

My heroism seems to not have been appreciated.

So firstly, I must establish: I am not allowed to pass out from casting a spell.

Grimstone says that is an extremely poor quality of a mage, to toss away our consciousness for the sake of a large gamble. 

Secondly: Casting this spell in particular at such a high output will leave me impaired for a day, which is fine.

Except for the fact that tomorrow is when we are supposed to be selling during the Rite.

It&#39;s morning right now, and Grimstone is out running errands. My arms are covered in bandages soaked in herbal oils. Certain herbs help with recovering mana, so maybe I’ll be up by- OH DAMN IT ALL.

I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF OUT THERE.

So what happened, and it frustrates me to say, is I missed. I hit Grimstone instead of her. Granted, it did scare her off, and Grimstone was unharmed, BUT STILL.
If that was a truly dangerous situation, it means I’d have made a grave mistake.  And to add insult to injury, I was standing too close to the edge of that house I was standing on. So when I passed out, I fell and began rolling down the roof like a bag of potatoes. Grimstone had to catch me, and then take me back to the inn.

*knock knock*

“Good Morning, is Clay awake. This is Nadia, may I come in?”

Who?

“Who?”

“Nadia, sir. Lord Necron’s servant.”

Oh, I see, Grimstone must have called in a favor.
Damn it.

“Sure, I guess.”
I try to pull the covers over my arms, but they are too numb to do anything useful. She comes in, wearing her usual mercenary-type clothing, with a brown cloak that hooks over her right shoulder, and hangs over her left arm. The cloak bears the Necron Family Crest, the image of the weapon Necron itself.

I awkwardly wave my arm at her.

“I see, it seems as bad as he said.”

HUH? AS WHO SAID? WHAT’D THAT USELESS ALCHEMIST SAY? LEMME AT HIM. 

I try to hide my displeasure, ”I suppose so...”
”Well, I suppose I will carry out my mission”, she says, grabbing a stool from the end of the room and dragging it to the corner of my bed.
”Mission?”
”Put simply, babysitting. Or perhaps, Clay-sitting,” she tilts her head, thinking of a good way to describe this.

**There is no good way to describe this**

---

Some time went by.
Occasionally, Nadia looks around the room. She seemed intrigued by the collection of gemstones on the table beside me. I try to break the silence, “So, uh, how did Lord Whosits feel about the gem?”

“Lord Necron...”, she stresses the man’s actual name,” seemed most pleased. Upon being informed however that you were injured on the way back, he immediately sent for me to come here.”

I see, he must have felt bad.
Damn it.

“Isn’t that nice of him-”
”Yes, Lord Necron is very generous.”
She hardly let me finish my sentence before praising her boss. What a suck-up.

“How are your arms?”, Nadia asks, breaking the silence that crept back.

I move them around a bit, demonstrating they are mostly functional, “They are still useable, but they need to recover fully for me to safely use magic.”
”Magic...so you are both truly mages?”
”Well sort of. I’m more of an apprentice. Grimstone can be considered a ‘true’ mage.”

“Even if you are an apprentice, being able to cast spells at your level should classify you as a mage.”
”I guess,” she seems to make some sense, but...”I’m still not like Grimstone.”

“Poor comparison.”
”Poor comparison??”
”Yes. You are as bright as you are foolish, Clay.”
Take a guy out for dinner first before you insult him, will ya?

“Wouldn’t those cancel out?”
”Not exactly. Yes, you are very quick to learn.  But you are still unwise. You lack proper discernment.”
”Alright alright, enough. I get enough of that from the Old Man.”
”Understood.”

She goes silent.

It feels like an eternity goes by.
”Hey, can I go outside?”
”No.”
”Okay but what if I go anyways?”
”I am permitted to use force”, she now seems less maid-like and more bodyguard-like. Crazy how one can flip personas so quickly.

I realize the bandages have mostly run dry, Nadia however already did and had been preparing a new set. It takes her a few minutes, but she replaces them, though they feel tighter.

“I, uh, can’t feel my arms. Ya mind loosening them?”

“It is because you can’t feel them that we have these on you.”

She does have a point. I technically didn’t feel that, I only guessed. My arms still feel like slabs of meat.

This woman’s way of never losing arguments irritates me. I feel even if she were wrong she’d convince me she’s right. 

“What exactly made you want to serve Lord Nero?”
”Lord Necron...”

Ah, so close.

“has many servants. However, my family’s goal has been to serve the Necrons since their establishment. The first of our family, Maximus, was given the surname ‘Ul-Necron’ as a token of appreciation. Ever since then, the Ul-Necrons have served the Necron family proudly.”

“So it&#39;s a family tradition?”
”No. It is our family purpose.”

A purpose? Before you are born? That’s baffling.

“So I guess your full name is Nadia Ul-Necron?”
”That is correct. Do you have a family name? If one such as Grimstone were to take someone under his tutelage, they must be of high birth.”

I think it over a little.

“I don’t think I really have a family.”
”Pardon? Are you an orphan?” She seems perplexed. 

“I wouldn’t call myself an orphan. I don’t really remember when-”

*My mind goes blankblankblankblankmymindgoesblankmyblankmindemptyemptyemptyhollowemptyblankclearvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidvoidddodidddd*

---

I wake up, it seems Nadia is still here. I guess I nodded off while we were talking.

“Are you feeling any better”, Nadia says, looking up from a book she&#39;s reading.

“I suppose? I can feel up to my elbows now”, I wave my numb hands at her.

“That&#39;s not what I- nevermind” she says, setting aside her book.

Did I say something strange while sleeping?

She continues, “Anyways, I will be going out for a moment to update Lord Necron. Do not leave the room.”

“I will not leave the room, understood.”

She looks at me once more, before walking out the door.

I&#39;m definitely aving the room.

---

“Just some fresh air, nothing more”, I mutter to myself as I walk outside the inn. It&#39;s been a few minutes since Nadia left. My eyes take a moment to adjust to the brighter scene before me. It looks like mid-afternoon. The street is busy. I see people passing by, a merchant selling expensive-seeming fabric, and children running through the streets playing games. The scene reminds me I haven’t explored Tomb at all yet.

Where should I go? I can see the Death Goddess’s palace at the center of the city.

[[Towards the Death Goddess’s Palace?]]
[[To the outskirts of Tomb]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Towards the Death Goddess’s Palace?" tags="" position="3399.6666666666665,898" size="100,100"># Towards the Death Goddess’s Palace?

It might be more fun to walk towards the Palace. It seems to be the busiest part of the city.

---

The city does in fact get much busier as I walk towards the center. I can’t count how many times I accidentally bumped into people on my way to the center because its so crowded. 

”Charm necklaces! Blessed directly by her majesty! We’re offering them for just one gold piece each!”

“Get yerself and yer family sum freshly killed mutton! Celebrate a New Year properly with a feast!”

New Year? What calendar are they on? I guess they consider the Rite of Prophecy to be the mark of a new year. Grimstone and I consider the longest day of the year the beginning of a new year, just like in Alexandria. But here it seems they mark it on this rite. I wonder if the other kingdoms declare a new year in different ways?

The Crowd starts to feel suffocating, but I keep moving. I eventually reach the walls of Empress’s Tomb.

After this point, I&#39;ve heard only guards and royal servants have been let through without invitation from the Death Goddess herself. I turn around and see the people swarm around the walls, merchants attempting to grab s

&quot;So Clay, have you made the preparations?&quot;

&quot;Our bags are packed, we just need to see if any carriage drivers are going in the direction of Crowfallen. We can probably hitch a ride with a caravan if we hire ourselves out as mercenaries, I checked for a few listings in the vilage.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now, let&#39;s see...&quot;

Grimstone gets up out of his rocking chair and goes to the floorboard under the carpet, pulling out a satchel.

&quot;You&#39;re going for the reserve stocks?&quot;

&quot;I kept these old things in case we needed to sell them. Seems like the optimal time for it.&quot;

&quot;Of course, though, will people want any of it?&quot;

&quot;Of course they will, take a look at this...&quot;

He pulls out a green gem from within. 

“This gem isn&#39;t meant to be worn, rather it&#39;s to be used. This one right here lets you light a fire easily.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you do that for free with two rocks from the ground?&quot;

He mutters something and pulls out another gem, this time yellow.

&quot;This gem is extremely hard, perfect for a chisel.&quot;

&quot;Well can you make it into a chisel itself?&quot;

&quot;Of course you can make it into a-&quot;

The Old Man thinks it over some more.

&quot;Not without any major difficulty.&quot;

I look at his bag, then at him, trying to convince myself people would actually buy any of this.

&quot;I assure you, this trip will be fruitful in more ways than one.&quot;

Grimstone says this with a strangely optimistic tone.

We continue to discuss the details of the trip, and before we know it, it&#39;s almost nighttime. We had already made preparations for the road a day ago, so it was simply a matter of making sure nobody breaks in while we&#39;re away. We stand outside the Shack as Grim turns to me and asks, &quot;Clay, do you know the incantation?&quot;

&quot;Well yeah, you taught me it earlier.&quot;

I reach for my staff and imagine the runes carved in it as an extension of my arm&#39;s veins. The runes begin to glow a faint blue.

*&quot;Illusions and reality are of the same substance. That which is real is mere illusions...That which is an illusion is of reality...Become like nothing. Vanish. Be destroyed. Be vacant. Be hollow. Be enveloped in the &lt;Shroud of Illusion!&gt;.&quot;*

The form of the Old Man&#39;s Shack begins to twist and blur into the surroundings, before completely vanishing.

I look at where the shack is hidden before returning my gaze to the old man. I held myself proudly, ready to be praised for a job well do-

&quot;You took too long.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Have you ever seen ME complain when you take half a year to choose what to buy in the market?&quot;

Thus, we set out on our merry way.

### The Serpent Valley

After about 3 days, we&#39;ve made our way to the Tombstone Mountains, and are now trekking towards the Serpent Valley. Another day of walking until we arrive.

Luckily, a few merchants agreed to hire us in exchange for free transport to the city. All the other adventurers were hired out already, so they&#39;re stuck with just us.

&quot;Behind you! &lt;i&gt;&lt;Earth Spire&gt;&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;

I whirl around and take a step back as a pointed mass of earth shot its way up from the ground, shattering the Skeleton that managed to reach my blind spot.

&quot;I could have handled that, Old Ma-AH!&quot;

I duck and roll, barely dodging the club that one particularly large Skeleton is holding.

Did I say ease? I take it back now.

&quot;What is that thing made of? Nothing human skeleton can be that big!&quot;

Its bones had a strange texture. I realized why as I took a closer look. The &quot;bones&quot; making up its body were themselves made of smaller bones.  It looked like a Skeleton made of Skeletons. It leaves me no room to note its structure as it takes another swing at me. 

Instantly, I grip my staff with both arms and hold it above me.

*CRACK!*

The wooden club begins to splinter on impact, rendering my arms numb as my field of vision starts to go dark. 

&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;Shockwave!&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
**BOOM***

The world around me spins as I&#39;m sent backward, my body is tossed against the ground as I roll for what felt like an eternity. My ears are ringing. I finally land face down, weakly looking up and at the Skeleton. I put around 20 meters between us. It, however, just recovered, and does not seem happy. Is this it? Do I die like this? I haven&#39;t even become rich yet. What happens to all my magical skills when I die?

Well. I will see the Death Goddess, either way, I guess.

I feel a tremor, a sudden white pulse fills my field of view.

I squint my eyes and see the giant Skeleton....No, pieces of it, flying in all directions. In the place of the monster was my master: I barely managed to catch the last second of his signature skill.

It&#39;s a simple skill, really. Just a physical enhancement. What makes it his signature? The fact that it&#39;s his go-to for stronger enemies. Usually, fire or ice works on weaker enemies, but in cases like these, he uses it to quickly end the battle. As far as I can tell, you don&#39;t want to be on the receiving end of it.

My body feels heavy, and I stumble back a bit as I rise. The ground feels like it&#39;s rolling beneath my feet. The sun feels too bright.

&quot;Well, what have you learned?&quot;, he asks.

&quot;Other than the taste of dirt? Not much.&quot;

&quot;Good. Know the taste of dirt, become accustomed to it. Anyone who wishes to become anything in life must know and love the taste of dirt because only after tasting it can one rise up stronger.&quot;

&quot;Old man, I know you say my cooking is bad, but now&#39;s not the time.&quot;, I respond, rolling my eyes.

&quot;As I always say, Clay, there is always a bit of &#39;you&#39; in every dish you make.&quot;

&quot;Yes yes well until you hire a maid, enjoy the taste of dirt.&quot;

After tending to our (my) wounds, we pick up our belongings and march onwards. The weather so far has been calm, sunny, not a cloud in sight. It feels comical considering we are going to the Death Goddess&#39;s domain, Crowgarden. Her kingdom is often associated with despair, as death typically is. Albeit, people are coming to her in a few days with major hopes for the future, perhaps the weather understands that. Though I wonder, why does the Death Goddess have the ability to see the future? I feel like I remember hearing it in a story once.

&quot;Yo Grim, what was the story you once told me about how the Death Goddess gained her future-sight?&quot;

He turns to me, &quot;&#39;Yo&#39;? &#39;Grim&#39;? I thought you lost that verbal tick of yours years ago.&quot;
&quot;Shut up, Old Man.&quot;

He shakes his head, chuckling, &quot;As for that story...hmm....&quot;, he looks off to the side, pausing for a moment, &quot;Ah yes, I remember. I believe legends say she actually stole that power from Seraphus in battle. Seraphus posed such a large threat since she not only could cause mass destruction but knew the Gods&#39; attacks before they even landed. Morrigan, however, used that against her, as she noticed Seraphus only ever looked so far into the future. She decided to plant a series of obvious attacks using her legendary weapon, Necron, so Seraphus would try dodging it. However, she had another attack planned immediately after that Seraphus had no time to prepare for. Using her ability to drain the life of her enemies, she made her move and ended up also stealing Seraphus&#39;s future sight. Seraphus only managed to escape however due to her sheer power. No amount of future sight can guard you against a being of power and absolute destruction.&quot; 

I see. This is in line with what I&#39;ve learned so far. Much of one&#39;s power depends on their Soul. Souls are like hands, in the sense they affect and interact with the world that hands can&#39;t touch. A hand can&#39;t interact with ideas, feel joy, or think for itself, but a soul does. The Gods must have the most powerful souls. 

And before we knew it. We arrived at Tomb, the center of the Death Goddess&#39;s Kingdom.

### Tomb

Tomb is called Tomb since the Death Goddess mostly stays here. 

***TO BE EDITED***
Despite the depressing-sounding name, the culture of her Kingdom regarding death is quite different than others. Death here is seen as rest, a reward for their labors. One who dies has completed their labors and is now resting. People who&#39;ve died here are treated with the greatest respect, especially those who&#39;ve died honorably. The Death Goddess personally attends the funerals of her soldiers, a sight that is rarely seen in other Kingdoms. Not a soul weeps here in death, it is seen as something joyful, almost like the birth of a child. The Funeral Rites include this proclamation that I sometimes ponder: &quot;He has finished his work and his work was fruitful, he is now resting.&quot; Of course, it depends on the type of Death. People who die of old age and in battle are considered &quot;Resting&quot;. People who die of murder or disease are considered to have &quot;Fallen Asleep&quot;. People who&#39;ve gone so far as to take their own lives are viewed distastefully, spoken of as &quot;Fallen Asleep before the Sun goes down.&quot; 

Prisoners, however, are never granted the death penalty. In fact, they are subjected to something quite bizarre. They are sent to Limbo, a place between the Life God and Death Goddess&#39;s Kingdom, where one neither lives nor dies. It is managed independently by a Noble who was chosen via a contract between the Life and Death Gods.

The Life and Death Gods themselves have a rather peaceful relationship. Any conflict between them only arises as a matter of something being poorly worded by the other. For the most part, their cultures are complementary versions of the other. 

&quot;WATCH OUT!&quot;

I stop my internal monologue suddenly, watching a horse pulling a wagon race past me, with two kids straddled on its back. The &quot;Tomb Knights&quot;, wearing brown and black cloaks, gave chase. For a city called the Tomb, it was quite lively.

After securing a room at an inn, I toss my bag against the wall and flop onto the bed, it&#39;s around sundown.

&quot;FINALLY. Every time we make these trips I miss real beds more and more.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too comfortable Clay, else you won&#39;t wake up tomorrow&quot;, the Old Man says, opening the curtains, orange light fills the room from the orange sunset.

&quot;Ugh....&quot;, I roll out of bed, as if having just woken up.

&quot;It&#39;s an important day tomorrow, we need to secure a place to set up&quot;, the old man sorts out the items in his bag, taking out a wooden sign that reads &quot;GRIMSTONE&#39;S STONES.&quot;

&quot;That sign is still horrible, we need a new name.&quot;

&quot;Non-negotiable.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s non-negotiable, you&#39;ve said it countless times, and I&#39;ll keep saying it, we need a new name.&quot;

He shakes his head and leaves the sign leaning against the nightstand. Snapping, he makes a small flame and lights the candle on the stand. He pulls out his diary and starts writing, as he usually does every night.

I grab a book from my satchel, it&#39;s a book of assorted legends from all over the land. I flip around till I find some from Crowfallen, and start reading.

After a few hours, Grimstone blows out the candle and tucks himself in. I place my book on the nightstand and stare out the window at the night sky. The legend of the Moon God came to mind as a I saw the crescent moon. They say that the Moon&#39;s shape is always chosen by the Moon God at night.

&quot;Clay?&quot;

&quot;What?&#39;

&quot;Go to sleep.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d you know I was awake?&quot;

&quot;Your breathing.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll stop breathing then.&quot;

&quot;Good luck&quot;, Grimstone mutters, turning over in his bed.

Staring out into the darkroom, my eyes grow tired. Slumber overcomes me.

### Preparations

Two days till the event.

&quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Yo Old Man.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Wake up.&quot;

&quot;......&quot;

&quot;Someone wants to buy-&quot;

&quot;I HAVE AWAKENED!&quot;

I tumble backward, just barely dodging the Old Man&#39;s forehead as it suddenly shot up.

&quot;Dammit....ugh...greedy as ever.&quot;

We&#39;ve been in debt for ages. Why? Grimstone lost a magic item he borrowed from The Noble, and it was worth quite a lot. We&#39;ve been trying to get the money together to pay him back, but it hasn&#39;t been going well. If I even mention someone wanting to buy something, Grimstone&#39;s focus instantly shifts. Usually, I am joking just to make him wake up, but today someone actually came knocking at our door.

&quot;Is it okay to come in? I don&#39;t want to impose if he&#39;s asleep&quot;, our prospective buyer says from behind the slightly ajar door.
&quot;No no, he&#39;s livelier than ever.&quot;

A man wearing a black and brown cloak over his shoulders, similar to that of the Tomb Knights, walks in, and Grimstone tilted his head smiling, &quot;Ah, well if it isn&#39;t Lord Necron?&quot;
The man scratched the side of his face, surveying the room, &quot;Please, you may call me Darius, Grimstone.&quot;

Did they seem to already know each other? It sure seemed so. 

&quot;Well then, Darius, what brings you here?&quot;
&quot;I just so happened to catch word of a certain Alchemist having entered the capital, right when we needed him most.&quot;
&quot;Oh? What will it be this time? Has the Necron Family been unable to find another crucial gem for the Offering?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tease us....but yes, we have been unable to secure a proper Serpent Diamond.&quot;

As I watch the two go back and forth about gems and this ritual, my mind drifts to the ritual itself.

From what I remember Grimstone saying, the Necron Family is of great importance in the Death Goddess&#39;s Kingdom. Part of the Rite of Prophecy is a reenactment of the day the first head of their family returned the weapon Necron to Morrigan. This was considered such an honorable feat that their family title was given that of the Goddess&#39;s weapon itself. The family prepared an assortment of gems every year to give to the Death Goddess, symbolizing the return of the weapon. In all honesty though, it seems to be a scheme for the Death Goddess to get rich.

&quot;So a Serpent Diamond worth 2,000 Gold Skulls. That&#39;s a hefty ask. Are you able to pay?&quot;

My eyes and ears perk up at hearing the amount 2,000 and Gold in the same sentence.

&quot;But of course. We&#39;ve been able to pay every time before, haven&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;That is true. But isn&#39;t this over a hundred times the normal amount? What makes this year so special?&quot;

&quot;This year is the 2,000th anniversary of the Crusades, and for this year&#39;s Crusade, they&#39;re announcing her Crusader during the Prophecy. This Rite is far more auspicious than the last ones.&quot;

&quot;The Death Goddess&#39;s Crusader you say...have you met him?&quot;

&quot;No, apparently she&#39;s keeping it a secret until the announcement. Rumors are saying, however, it&#39;s a blacksmith.&quot;

&quot;A blacksmith? A Crusader? What an.... eccentric choice.&quot;

The Crusades... Grimstone described it as a grand tournament issued by the Gods. Each God selects one person from their Kingdom to represent their nation in battle. The battle itself, however, is not between the Crusaders. Rather it is the Crusaders against the Furies, monstrous beings which appear from the earth. Not much is known about their origins. Some say they are the manifestation of our own evil. I think they are ghosts. 

Grimstone&#39;s voice finds its way into my internal monologue, &quot;....and so you want us to secure it from the abandoned mines?&quot;
&quot;That is correct, I will have the payment immediately available once the item is retrieved.&quot;
Ah, so we are exploring a mineshaft now. Fantastic. Totally in-line with our plans to sell gems.
&quot;I guess I should go stock up on supplies, huh&quot;, I can&#39;t help but think how we are going to spend on supplies and might not even find the damned rock.

&quot;No need, I had already made arrangements. Nadia-!&quot;
&quot;At your command, Lord Necron.&quot;
A woman dressed in a black hood enters, she has the appearance of a bodyguard, but the voice of a servant. She has with her a bag, and within it is an assortment of potions, matches, and dried foodstuffs, &quot;This should suffice, no?&quot;, the servant says while looking up at Lord Necron.

&quot;Yes, that will do,&quot; his tone of voice here seems to establish the difference in their status. Would that make us pseudo-nobles, because he uses a different tone with us? I shrug at the thought and start gearing up.

### Into The Mines

I look down into the cave, and it feels like it looks back at me. The dead torch at its mouth and the worn pickaxes near it make the scene feel dead.

&quot;And away we go!&quot;
The old man says, suddenly flying past me. At least he&#39;s lively.

I channel energy into my legs and leap into the mines. My vision is encased in darkness, but luckily I have a general sense of what&#39;s around me. I wouldn&#39;t be the disciple of a blind warrior if I relied on sight all the- 
&quot;CLAY!&quot;
My body goes numb. The pain is terrible. I think I broke multiple bones. I lost my bearing. It hurts. 

I lie prone on the cave floor, I sense something in front of me.

The letter says that he is to go to Alexandria and present this to the guards at the entrance, further instructions will be given once it is processed.

Grimstone also tells him this is his chance to go and do magical research in Alexandria, as the libraries there are chock full of knowlege.

My eyes feel like they have started to adjust to the darkness, and I make out the vague shape of a man with misshapen hair. 
&quot;Clay, I told you not to fly blind&quot;, I can hear him shaking his head from his voice. I feel him grab my arm and drag me up.
He casts healing spells on me, and all I can do is mutter, trying to think of something to say. I still haven&#39;t mastered fighting without sight as he can. I&#39;m not even a novice. Moving without sight is not even feasible for me. How am I supposed to advance? I&#39;m a capable fighter, but unless I can do what seems impossible, what&#39;s left?

&quot;Clay...&quot;, his voice bears down on me. 

Oh boy....I&#39;m in for it, aren&#39;t I....?
&quot;Y-yes?&quot;
&quot;No more using the &lt;Blind Leap&gt;, got it? It&#39;s still beyond your skill range.&quot;
&quot;B-...fine.&quot;
I can&#39;t seem to defend myself. Grimstone&#39;s techniques are still leagues ahead of mine. Blind Leap enables him to move at insane speeds at the cost of both mana, and sight(only as you move, of course). The trick for him, of course, is that he is already blind. It amounts to being the perfect skill for him. He told me about the times he&#39;d use it to get through some labyrinths without even needing to fight. He&#39;d go in, take what he needs, and leave. It was like picking fruit. 

&quot;Hm...What an interesting Cave.&quot;
&quot;What&#39;s so special about it?&quot;

&quot;The way it winds downwards and around, it seems to go on in circles and twisting, and it seems like it reaches the surface at another point here. The mine seems to really start at the lowest point.&quot;
&quot;Didn&#39;t Seraphus once fight Morrigan here? She could&#39;ve dug into the ground and formed the tunnels with her body while slithering through the rocks.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...but if so....there seems to be an eerie lack of monsters here.&quot;
Grimstone&#39;s experience from his past gives him enough intuition to say how a cave is structured from how the echo sounds. Granted he can&#39;t give you a detailed map. He picks up on certain *qualities* that are present in the echoes throughout the cave. I think the part about the mine is at the bottom though was simply a good guess from not having seen it thus far.

&quot;Well, I believe the mine should be right here-&quot;
He takes his staff and props it against a boulder, pushing it aside nearly effortlessly, revealing a stretch of tunnels that seem much more man-made. 

&quot;Clay, remember your breathing incantations. The air down here likely is not pure.&quot;
&quot;Yes yes...*Oh wind that breathes life to those who accept it, become as a veil to guard me against impurity. Let my words speak peace and my chest bear life. The wind holds with it the stories of our ancestors, the tales of heroism, of failure, of life, of death....&quot;*
The breathing incantation is an extremely long and intricate chant, something resembling a prayer to the wind. What it actually is, is a high-level spell that has been fine-tuned down to the syllable. There are many drawbacks to spells. Powerful spells with short incantations have extraordinarily high mana costs. Spells with short incantations and low mana cost have low power output. This spell has no need for power output, but rather consistency. In fact, the entire incantation spans the length of a small spellbook. Nobody knows the entire incantation, but that&#39;s not important to know, as the power output is so low that the recoil is nonexistent. The spell creates pure air in a thin film around the user and does so during the incantation, and usually lasts for a few seconds after pausing or stopping the incantation (enough to briefly say something). Unfortunately, there is no way to have this spell run indefinitely with a short incantation without a much higher drain to your mana supply (Unless you&#39;re Grimstone, he&#39;s gone so far as to make this spell a passive ability of his, from inhuman amounts of training).

Of course, this becomes problematic once we have to cast other spells, as we can&#39;t chant two spells simultaneously. This is where spells begin to fail as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; to life&#39;s problems. If we **really** needed to cast other spells, however, we have charms attached to our belts that fill our lungs with air, at a very high mana cost. Charms only are useful for emergencies, when getting out alive in the present moment is more important than keeping your mana available for miscellaneous tasks.

As we continue to walk through the cave, I notice the sparkling of some gems. These aren&#39;t useful gems, however. The most common crystal, Earth Mica, is flimsy yet has a distinct shine to it. It has no real use...speaking of useless...

&quot;Hey Grimstone?&quot;

&quot;Why do I feel like you&#39;re secretly mocking me?&quot;

Dammit, he saw right through me. Well he&#39;s blind so...heard through me? Sensed through me? Tasted through me? Smelled through me? I shrug, pointing at the stretch of tunnels before us, &quot;Mockery aside-&quot;

&quot;So you were-?&quot;,  he turns towards me suddenly.

I continue, &quot;-how much further do we need to go?&quot;

&quot;Tsk,&quot; he doesn&#39;t seem to want to let the joke go,&quot;as far as we need to. More likely about 30 steps this way&quot;, he takes a turn at a fork in the tunnel. I begin counting steps.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; he stretches his arms out, pointing towards something. I can&#39;t tell what it is within the darkness of the cave.

&quot;-No reaction? Oh it must be dark then.&quot;

Right on the money. He creates a small flame at the end of his finger, then condenses it into a shining orb, increasing the intensity. Shielding my eyes from the light source itself, I begin to see red gems all across the ground and cave walls.

MONEY.

ALL I SEE IS MONEY.

WE WILL FINALLY BE OUT OF DEBT.

AND THIS IS ENOUGH TO LIVE IN LUXURY.

&quot;*rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.&quot;*

&quot;Grim was that you?&quot;

&quot;No...?&quot;

I feel a knot form in my chest, as I look towards the large cave chamber.

The area seems large and mostly vacant in the middle. There is a large mass of shifting stones there but nothing else.

Wait.

Shifting stones?

&quot;Grimstone is that aURHG-&quot;, something yanks me off to the side.

Where I was standing, a spike made of red crystal took its place, Grimstone pulled me away by my collar.

&quot;...Crystal dragon, and a strong one too, it seems.&quot;

The shifting mass of stones in the middle of the room begins to form into a ferocious lizard-like creature, with a face resembling a rhinoceros, but broader and more like a shield. The back is covered in spiked crystals, along with a swinging tail whose end is a dense mass of rock with spikes of the same kind. The front of this creature seems to be adorned in crystalline armor.

Grimstone thinks it over, &quot;If there&#39;s a Crystal Dragon here, that means that the crystals here are all the unusable...except...&quot;

I gesture towards him to continue, I don&#39;t want to cut off my breathing incantation.

&quot;The dragon&#39;s horn, on its nose. The only crystal that won&#39;t cause any real harm to anything...aside from us if it hits us.&quot;

We should...

Anya actually is hiding under Clay&#39;s bed. She is going to give away her position when Clay lays down on his bed thinking she&#39;s gonna be crushed
Clay will prepare to fight, Anya is going to look panicked and put her hands up to show she&#39;s not a threat

Clay will let Anya come out and speak

Clay thinks its just a run-of-the-mill thief, and they could probably survive a fall from this height. So he&#39;ll fire a spell strong enough to just knock them off balance and hit the ground.

Right as Anya hits the ground and Clay is about to close the window, he hears her crying. 
Cue the &quot;What did I do omg&quot; moment. 
At this moment, a more skilled Page will instantly appear behind Clay, with a knife to his neck.
She will tell him that he&#39;s being let off the hook because he was approached by a novice page.
He will look down, no longer seeing the page there, he&#39;ll look around: only to briefly see the two pages disappearing in the alleys(one carrying the other).
He will also watch an arrow nearly hit his face and lodge itself into the wall behind him, with a note attatched, the note has the message
The message has the info Anya was trying to convey

Anya does her best to try and give the message
After an intense bout of &quot;um, uh, its uh, its&quot; and Clay starting to get annoyed saying &quot;SPIT IT OUT ALREADY&quot;, Anya finally tells him that Sofiya is summoning him to the Royal grounds.
She will tell him a dragon carriage will await him in two days late into the night to take him to the royal grounds.

Clay decides he wants to look for clues as to what exactly happened. He will investigate his room for clues, finding none. He will ask around, finding mixed opinions. 

He does hear about the incidents of someone going around attacking the Wisdom God&#39;s Crusaders, but he knows that can&#39;t be it because nobody knows he is her&#39;s yet.

He also hears rumors about a secretive spy network that works all throughout Alexandria, but the legends about them are so high-strung he is in disbelief. 

Clay is baffled at the situation, and just decides maybe this is a sign he should switch where he sleeps, and decides to sleep outdoors

Clay decides that the nighttime sky of Alexandria is too beautiful not to camp under, so he goes to the outskirs of town and sets up a small camp with the explorer&#39;s kit he has. 

Anya appears again, but because she has no place to hide, she has to sneak towards Clay, and miserably fails. Clay notices and chooses between fighting or talking this time. 

[[Ignore Anya at the Camp]]
[[Talk to Anya at the Camp]]

After a bit of back and forth miscommunication, and Clay dealing a hefty blow to her poor ego, Clay finally understands he&#39;s been summoned to the Royal Palace. 
The carriage driver has been looking, alongside Anya, all day, and when Clay and Anya finally arrive he seems visibly relieved.
They finally go to the temple.
[[To the temple by Carriage]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Cutscene 0 Replacement Text" tags="" position="4479,43" size="100,100">&quot;It begins with the 7 Supreme Beings who oversaw the world. 

The seven gods watched over their followers who were complacent in their role. Humanity to them was an existence that existed with no greater purpose or greater calling. Over the next centuries, the Gods&#39; names would be spread.

Vitus, the God of Life, began to change humans by giving them Life. And with life came the ability to live and choose for themselves. Thus he gave them Life.

Morrigan, the Goddess of Death, however, saw that giving the human life an end would give them rest from the troubles that life had offered them while also making it so that the human life becomes more meaningful. Thus she gave them Death.

Then, Sofiya, the Goddess of Wisdom, attempted to share her wisdom with mankind. She wished to give them the knowledge to learn, teach, and grow throughout their lives. Thus she gave them Wisdom.

Polemos, the God of War, taught the humans War, as Polemos felt lives without conflict were simply too monotonous to be considered worth living. Thus he gave them War.

Solus, God of the Day, and Luna, Goddess of the Night, looked towards the heavens. They decided to grant the human life structure, and their eternal dance is what creates the pattern of Day and Night that governs mankind. Thus, they gave them the Day, and the Night.

However, while the other Gods wished for the humans to grow, learn, and thrive, Seraphus did not share their benevolence. Humanity disgusted her, with their flaws and arrogance causing her to resent them simply for existing. She saw the Gods creating something which she believed ought to be destroyed. She believed that since the humans would inevitably wipe themselves out through their greed and malice, it was better for her to wipe them out. Thus, the Chaos-Serpent God began her rampage over the world, bringing mayhem and monstrosities in her wake, causing death and destruction on a magnitude never seen before. She caused earthquakes, demolished humanity&#39;s greatest structures, created all manner of evil creatures from the human corpses, and feasted upon all the ravaged and tormented souls. Her final plan was to encircle the earth that she may swallow it up for good, bringing an end to this futile game the Gods seemed foolishly intent on playing.

However, the 6 other Gods took a stand against the Great Serpent and sealed her with the 7 seals, and to this day Seraphus lies there, awaiting her release once more...

THE NEXT DAY
Clay has a knock at his door. After the last few nights of suspicious visitors, he approaches the door with suspicion but it ends up being his Mentor for the next few weeks. For the next few weeks, he will be tested in his ability to fight and trained to handle Furies. 
It will start with a sparring session with his Mentor. He gets &quot;clapped&quot; in mere seconds, many many times.
